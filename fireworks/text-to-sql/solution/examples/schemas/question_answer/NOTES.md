A Q&A site a la Stack Overflow: users, questions, answers, and voting.

## D6 pipeline

`question_answer.postgres.sql` (vendored, verbatim) -> `foundation.ddl.parse_ddl` -> `graph.json` (dialect-neutral entity graph) -> `foundation.ddl.render_ddl` -> `sqlite.sql` (executed by D9's sample-database lifecycle).

## parse_ddl warnings

- column 'users'.'id': Postgres SERIAL is an identity/autoincrement pseudo-type, not modeled -- captured as 'INT'; the sequence/autoincrement behavior itself is dropped
- column 'questions'.'id': Postgres SERIAL is an identity/autoincrement pseudo-type, not modeled -- captured as 'INT'; the sequence/autoincrement behavior itself is dropped
- skipped non-CREATE-TABLE statement: CREATE INDEX ON questions(author_id)
- column 'answers'.'id': Postgres SERIAL is an identity/autoincrement pseudo-type, not modeled -- captured as 'INT'; the sequence/autoincrement behavior itself is dropped
- skipped non-CREATE-TABLE statement: CREATE INDEX ON answers(question_id)
- column 'answer_votes'.'id': Postgres SERIAL is an identity/autoincrement pseudo-type, not modeled -- captured as 'INT'; the sequence/autoincrement behavior itself is dropped
